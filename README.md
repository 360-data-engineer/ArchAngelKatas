# The Road Warrior - An Itinerary Management Startup
## Introduction
The Road Warrior wants to build the next-generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations organized by trip either online (web) or through their mobile device.

## Requirements
- Poll email looking for travel-related emails
- Filter and whitelist certain emails
- The system must interface with the agencyâ€™s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.).
- Updates must be in the app within 5 minutes of an update (better than the competition)
- Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well.
- Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard.
- Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip.
- Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms
- Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel usage
- Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users' trips for various purposes - travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on.

## User Journey
The following flowchart describes a user's journey end-to-end covering major features. 

We will regard the email used as the email ID that is linked with any trips booked online when the user signs up, and we will request a one-time authorization for email inbox crawling. The user may always enable or deny email crawl access in the app's Profile area. If the email address used during sign-up is not linked with a specific booking, the user can always forward such booking-related notifications to The Road Warrior's inbox for further processing and itinerary adjustments. We also support the user's entire, end-to-end manual itinerary construction.

## Architecture Walkthrough
The Road Warrior has been designed by adopting Microservices Architecture (as discussed in the /ADRS/ADR_1_microservices.md). 
The choice of containers & their services mapping have been done basis the actor-actions approach.
We have two actors - The user and the system. 

### Actors-Actions Approach
Their actions have been described in the image below.

Enhancement: To notify the user regarding updates, we are also considering a De-Duplication block at the Client. If the De-Dup service finds the update redundant, the update is dropped. Otherwise, the user is notified regarding the same.
